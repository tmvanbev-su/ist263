    Hello! My name is Tyler VanBeveren and I am currently a senior at Syracuse University. I am majoring in Information Management & Technology with an interest in project management and digital strategy. I have been placed on the Deanâ€™s List for my respective college of the School of Information Studies three times during my academic career. Outside of my academic work, I enjoy binge watching Game of Thrones, listening to all kinds of music, staying active and spending time with family and friends (especially my golden retriever Spencer!) Welcome to my website!
